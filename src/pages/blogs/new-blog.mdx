# Welcome!

So, on my old site that I built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), I used to call the [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) API to get my blogs and display them on my site. However, it seemed like Hashnode's CDN caching of blogs was not getting updated when I published a new blog or updated existing ones.

So, I decided to build a new blog site using [Astro](https://astro.build/). I had used Astro before on a very old portfolio (one of my firsts). So, this was a fun homecoming.

First, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is amazing. I really missed that with the Hashnode API. Secondly, editing MDX files right in my IDE is a plus.

Over the next few days, I'll be migrating my old blogs and also writing some new ones.

Now, let's talk about the portfolio itself. This is my first frontend project deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/). I am a huge fan of the product. And now that they've announced their own hardware [(Railway Metal)](https://docs.railway.com/railway-metal), I can't wait to deploy more projects on it. I would miss [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) though but change is good.

Cheers!
