After watching [Tsoding](http://twitch.tv/tsoding) struggle with importing a C Library ([raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)) in his recent stream. I decided to make the process easier and more straightforward for developers. I totally agree that the official documentation is not very clear and lacks examples. This blog aims to address that issue.

So we start by creating a swift package using

```bash
mkdir SwiftRaylib
cd SwiftRaylib
swift package init --name SwiftRaylib --type executable
```

This initialises our `SwiftRaylib` Package and the folder structure should look like this

```bash
SwiftRaylib/
├── Package.swift
└── Sources
    └── main.swift
```

Now let's move the C Library in the Sources directory. We will use the raylib 5.0 release for macOS.

Note that for Swift Package Manager(SPM) to include a C Library in project, the C Library should have a include directory with the header files present in it. In our case, raylib's file structure looks like this

```bash
raylib-5.0_macos/
├── CHANGELOG
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── include
│   ├── raylib.h
│   ├── raymath.h
│   └── rlgl.h
└── lib
    ├── ...
```

where the include directory does contains all the necessary header files.

Now another important change to make is creating a new folder in Sources with the same name as that of the Swift Project and moving the `main.swift` file inside it.

```bash
SwiftRaylib/
├── Package.swift
└── Sources
    ├── SwiftRaylib
    │   └── main.swift
    └── raylib-5.0_macos
```

And now the last step is to edit `Package.swift`

Presently `Package.swift` should look like this

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftRaylib",
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "SwiftRaylib")
    ]
)
```

We are going to add a `products` parameter that takes in an array of the C Library and the Swift Executable

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftRaylib",
    products: [
        .library(name: "raylib-5.0_macos", targets: ["raylib-5.0_macos"]),
        .executable(
            name: "SwiftRaylib",
            targets: ["SwiftRaylib"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "SwiftRaylib"),
    ]
)
```

Secondly we will modify the `targets` by adding a target of our C Library and adding that as a dependency to our Swift executable target. We will also add a `swiftSettings` that enables the interoperability between C and Swift.

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "SwiftRaylib",
    products: [
        .library(name: "raylib-5.0_macos", targets: ["raylib-5.0_macos"]),
        .executable(
            name: "SwiftRaylib",
            targets: ["SwiftRaylib"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "raylib-5.0_macos"),
        .executableTarget(
            name: "SwiftRaylib",
            dependencies: ["raylib-5.0_macos"],
            swiftSettings: [.interoperabilityMode(.Cxx)]),
    ]
)
```

Now running `swift run` should compile and run the project.

To test we will import raylib in `main.swift` and write a simple program using `raymath.h`

```swift
import raylib_5_0_macos

let v1 = Vector2(x: 3.0, y: 2.0)
let v2 = Vector2(x: 4.0, y: 7.0)

print("Distance between \(v1) and \(v2) is \(Vector2Distance(v1, v2))")
```

The output should be

```bash
Distance between Vector2(x: 3.0, y: 2.0) and Vector2(x: 4.0, y: 7.0) is 5.0990195
```

Note that `Vector2` and `Vector2Distance()` is being imported from the `raylib`.
